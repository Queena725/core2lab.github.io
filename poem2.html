        <h1>SLEEPING IN THE FOREST
      
        </h1>

        <h2>by Mary Oliver</h2>
        <ul>
            
        <li> I thought the earth remembered me, </il>
        
        <li>she took me back so tenderly,</li>
        <li>arranging her dark skirts, her pockets,</li>
        <li> full of lichens and seeds. </li>
          <li> I slept as never before, a stone on the river bed,</li>
          <li>nothing between me and the white fire of the stars</li>
          <li> but my thoughts, and they floated light as moths</li>
            <li>among the branches of the perfect trees.</li>
            <li>All night I heard the small kingdoms</li> 
            <li>breathing around me, the insects, </li>
            <li>and the birds who do their work in the darkness.</li>
            <li>All night I rose and fell, as if in water,</li>
            <li>grappling with a luminous doom. By morning </li>
            <li>I had vanished at least a dozen times </li>
            <li>into something better.</li>
        
          </ul>
